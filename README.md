# Morse-Code-Detection-through-eyes-using-Machine-Learning-
This study presents an innovative approach to Morse code detection using eye blinks, aiming to facilitate non-verbal communication for individuals with speech impairments. The proposed system leverages computer vision and machine learning techniques to accurately recognize and interpret eye blink patterns as Morse code signals.
